#Our complete program will look like this:
# Python Code Chapter 10

# Import the LED class from the gpiozero control library
from gpiozero import LED

# Import the sleep class from time library
from time import sleep

# Here we define the three leds objects and connection

# The Left Yellow led is connected to gpio PIN 7
Left_yellow_led = LED(7)

# The red led is connected to gpio PIN 8
Stop_red_led = LED(8)

# The Right Yellow led is connected to gpio PIN 11
Right_yellow_led = LED(11)

#Let's start by turning the all lights off
Left_yellow_led.off()
Stop_red_led.off()
Right_yellow_led.off()
